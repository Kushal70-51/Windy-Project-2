physics_anchor.py

REPLACES ml_forecast_model.py.

Provides a deterministic, physics-based BASELINE ("anchor") estimate of
solar generation (MW) for one forecast block's feature row -- no ML
model training, no LLM call. This is pure math:

    1. Solar elevation as a rough "clear sky" proxy (0 at night, maxing
       out around solar noon).
    2. Attenuate that by how much cloud is present, blending the
       image-derived brightness/cloud stats with the video motion
       coverage stats.
    3. Scale by plant capacity and performance ratio.

WHY THIS EXISTS in the new architecture: instead of asking the LLM to
invent a number from scratch (unreliable, non-deterministic, hard to
keep physically sensible across 8 forecast horizons), the LLM's job
becomes ADJUSTING this grounded anchor value based on retrieved similar
historical cases -- e.g. "anchor says 2.3 MW, but similar past cloud
patterns show generation tends to be ~12% lower than this formula
predicts, so adjust down." That is a much more constrained, reliable
task for an LLM than free-form number generation.

This file has NO dependency on a trained model file -- there is nothing
to "load". It always produces a number, from day one, using only the
feature row.
