"""
image_feature_extraction.py

Extracts NUMERIC color + brightness features from each of the captured
Windy layer screenshots (satellite, wind, solarpower, clouds, rain).

WHY: Instead of asking an LLM to "look at" the screenshots and describe
them, we compute simple, deterministic image statistics -- average
brightness, average color saturation/hue, and the % of "bright" pixels
in a region centered on the plant. These numbers become inputs to the
ML model (see ml_forecast_model.py), the same way video_motion_features.py
turns the video into numbers instead of raw pixels.

NOTE: an OCR-based extension (reading exact numbers off the marker popup
and bottom forecast panel via Tesseract) was tried and removed for now,
since Tesseract-OCR isn't installed yet and the priority right now is a
STABLE feature schema for continuous data collection. The color/brightness
stats below are the only features this module produces -- no external
OCR dependency, no risk of the schema changing again while you collect
this week's training data. OCR can be re-added later as a separate step
once you're ready, without disturbing this file's current column set.
