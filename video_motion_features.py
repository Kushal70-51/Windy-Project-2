video_motion_features.py

STANDALONE script/module that takes the recorded Windy satellite/cloud
animation video (the "_clean.mp4" file produced by test_multi_image.py)
and extracts NUMERIC cloud-motion + cloud-coverage features using
classical computer vision (optical flow + brightness thresholding) --
instead of asking an LLM to "watch" the raw video.

WHY: Vision-language models like Gemini are not reliable at precisely
quantifying motion (exact direction/speed) from video frames -- they can
describe things qualitatively ("clouds seem to be moving north-east") but
struggle to give consistent, reproducible numbers. Classical optical flow
gives deterministic, math-based numbers every time. The idea is:
    1. This script processes the video and produces a short text summary
       with real numbers (direction, speed, cloud-coverage trend).
    2. That summary text gets sent to Gemini ALONGSIDE the screenshots
       (instead of, or in addition to, the raw video) -- so Gemini is
       reasoning over solid numeric facts rather than raw pixels.

Requirements:
    pip install opencv-python numpy

Usage (standalone, from the command line):
    python video_motion_features.py path/to/SIRMOUR_satellite_..._clean.mp4

Usage (as a module, e.g. import this from test_multi_image.py later):
    from video_motion_features import analyze_video

    features = analyze_video(video_path)
    if features:
        print(features["summary_text"])
        # features["summary_text"] can be added into the Gemini prompt,
        # e.g. as an extra line before the screenshots list.
