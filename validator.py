"""
validator.py

Sanity-checks the LLM's adjusted predictions (from llm_predictor.py)
before they get stored or shown to anyone. This is pure deterministic
code -- no LLM, no ML -- acting as a safety net so a bad/unusual LLM
response can never produce a physically nonsensical or wildly
inconsistent set of predictions.

Checks applied, per block:
    1. Range clip: adjusted_mw must be within [0, plant capacity].
    2. Deviation limit: if the LLM's adjustment strays too far from the
       physics anchor (as a fraction of the anchor value), it gets
       pulled back toward the anchor instead of trusted outright -- the
       anchor is assumed to be "roughly right", so a huge swing usually
       means the LLM over-reached rather than found something real.

Checks applied across the whole 8-block sequence:
    3. Smoothness: block-to-block MW change is capped at
       MAX_STEP_CHANGE_MW -- solar generation does not usually jump
       drastically within one 15-minute step under gradually changing
       cloud cover, so a sudden large jump is more likely an LLM
       inconsistency than reality.

Every adjustment made here is recorded (was_adjusted + adjustment_note),
so nothing is silently changed -- you can always see what the validator
did and why when reviewing predictions.
